# Implementation Notes

## Design Decisions

### Standard Library Only

The implementation uses only Python's standard libraries (`datetime` and `typing`) to ensure maximum compatibility and minimize dependencies.

### UTC Timezone

All timestamps are converted to UTC timezone (denoted by the 'Z' suffix in the ISO8601 format) for consistency and to avoid ambiguity.

### Error Handling

The function includes comprehensive error handling:
- Type checking to ensure the input is a valid numeric type (int or float)
- Exception handling for potential errors during timestamp conversion
- Proper error messages to help diagnose issues

### Type Hints

Type hints are used throughout the code to improve readability and enable static type checking with tools like mypy.

## ISO8601 Format

The ISO8601 format used is:
```
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ
```

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date part (year, month, day)
- `T` is the literal character separating date and time
- `hh:mm:ss.sss` is the time part (hours, minutes, seconds, with optional milliseconds)
- `Z` indicates UTC timezone (Zulu time)

## Edge Cases

The implementation handles several edge cases:

1. **Millisecond precision**: Float timestamps are properly converted with millisecond precision.
2. **Epoch time**: The timestamp 0 correctly converts to '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z'.
3. **Pre-epoch dates**: Negative timestamps (representing dates before January 1, 1970) are handled correctly.
4. **Very large timestamps**: The function raises a ValueError for timestamps that are too large to be processed.
5. **Invalid inputs**: Non-numeric inputs are rejected with a TypeError.

## Performance Considerations

The implementation is straightforward and efficient, with minimal overhead. The `datetime` module's `fromtimestamp` function is used for the core conversion, which is highly optimized.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Support for different output formats
- Option to specify a different timezone
- Batch processing for multiple timestamps
