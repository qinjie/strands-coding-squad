  "summary": "Completed comprehensive code review of the unix_to_iso8601 function. The function is well-designed, follows Python best practices, and correctly implements the conversion from UNIX timestamps to ISO8601 format with UTC timezone. Minor improvement suggestions include adding bounds checking, precision control, and formal unit tests.",
